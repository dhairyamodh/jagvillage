						<p style="text-align:justify; font-weight: 600;">Jorja Ann Gorham was born April 8, 2006, the first child of Dave and Jodi and the first grandchild for both of their families. Her brother Davis arrived two years later on August 6, 2008.   Since the day Jorja arrived in this world she proved to be a force to be reckoned with.  She always knew what she wanted, which was often her mama, and carried the fortitude of her father.  She and her brother had endless hours of fun and rivalry.  This family of four enjoyed camping, travelling, playing games, watching movies and all types of sports.</p>
								
								
						<p style="text-align:justify; font-weight: 600;">When we think of Jorja, we think of someone who loves her family, her friends, soccer, skating and hockey, all kinds of art, (although her favourites were face painting, button and slime making), animals and AWESOMENESS!</p>
					</div>
					<div class="col-md-12">
					<p style="text-align:justify; font-weight: 600;">In mid January 2018, Jorja was diagnosed with Acute Lymphocytic Leukemia and given a good prognosis.  On January 31st, 2018, Jorja’s life was abruptly ended when she died of undetected medical complications.  This left not only her family and friends, but an entire village in agony.</p>
								
								<p style="text-align:justify; font-weight: 600;">In Jorja’s short time here on earth she touched so many lives and found a special place in people’s hearts that only she could occupy. She built unforgettable bonds with her family, friends at school, sports teams and art community.  Jorja was often very active in community events, and could often be found downtown Bowmanville with her face painted, recruiting other children to love art.  Jorja’s love extended beyond the barriers of just humankind, and extended to embrace all living things!  Her relationship with animals was unique.  All animals including reptiles comforted her in ways that no person ever could have, and this love was reciprocated and multiplied when she gave it back.</p>
								
								<p style="text-align:justify; font-weight: 600;">Through the generous donations of our friends and family, Jorja’s Awesome Grief Village (J.A.G. Village) is a legacy built on the strongest foundation of compassion, love and awesomeness.  It is a space for honouring grief and our loved ones, tolerating the intolerable, and for collective healing. We understand that grief touches every part of our lives, and is not a problem to be fixed, but love that needs to be nurtured and honoured.  Our relationships do not die when our people die, we have opportunities to continue these relationships into our futures. J.A.G. Village is evidence of this.  </p>
								
								<p style="text-align:justify; font-weight: 600;">J.A.G. (Jorja’s initials) Village, is short for Jorja’s Awesome Grief Village and also represents Jorja’s love of animals and jaguar face painting. </p>

							<p style="text-align:justify; color:#fff;">To promote and create a culture both internally and externally of J.A.G.

						<p style="text-align:justify; font-weight: 600;"><font color="white">Kindness is described as the act of doing no harm to others. Here at J.A.G. Village, we ask that this kindness be extended to ourselves. We acknowledge that all feelings and thoughts are important.  We observe, and feel them with kindness.</font></p>

							       <div class="col-md-9" style="text-align:justify; font-weight: 600; margin-bottom:20px;">Jodi Gorham is a Registered Social Worker with the Ontario College of Social Workers and Social Service Workers (OCSWSSW). More importantly, she is the mother of two children, Davis, who she gets to hold in her arms and Jorja who she now holds in her heart.  Jodi’s personal experiences with trauma and grief, along with her 20 years of professional experience in children’s mental health drive her passion for honouring grief and supporting people of all ages. Jodi tends to use more of a companionship model to interact with bereaved people, rather than traditional medical models.  Medical models often align with the dominant culture which pathologizes grief, rather than embracing it as a natural and normal response to loss.  Jodi holds a space where unique grief is honoured.  A space where love and loss, joy and pain and many other emotions can co-exist, while simultaneously and collaboratively learning to walk the paths that life has given us. For those of you who are interested in Jodi’s other professional credentials, she has the relevant training and experience to draw upon other therapeutic approaches such as: Cognitive Behavioural Therapy, Dyadic Developmental Psychotherapy, Narrative, and Solution-Focused therapies. </div>

Journaling and diligently providing the behind-the-scene help for J.A.G. Village. Along with raising her sons Ethan and Owen, Jen looks forward to joining Jodi in helping to shift grief culture and supporting the families of the J.A.G. Village community.
